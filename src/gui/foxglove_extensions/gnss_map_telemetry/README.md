# GNSS Map Telemetry

Foxglove custom Map panel with a fixed top-right legend for latitude, longitude,
base_link heading, and speed over ground. It consumes
`/sensor/vehicle_gnss/fix/raw`, `/gui/ground_speed_mps`, `/tf`, and `/tf_static`.
The panel renders OpenStreetMap tiles with its bundled Leaflet 1.9.4 runtime.
After centering on the first valid fix, the map remains under manual pan and zoom
control while the vessel arrow moves and rotates.

Install [gnss-map-telemetry-0.2.0.foxe](gnss-map-telemetry-0.2.0.foxe) by dragging it
into Foxglove, then import `foxglove_setting.json`.

The vessel arrow points along the `base_link` +X axis. Its orientation is resolved
from the `map -> base_link` TF chain, assuming the `map` frame is ENU (+X east,
+Y north). If the chain is unavailable, the panel shows a position dot and `HDG --`.

Rebuild the self-contained extension and `.foxe` archive without Node.js or npm:

```bash
./scripts/package.sh
```
