# simple_manual

Real-vessel manual bringup and velocity-command input for the maintained X4
thruster control pipeline. Navigation is not started.

The launch starts:

- MID360S, UM982, Advanced Navigation Spatial, and wired Drogger drivers
- the complete localization launch
- the LiDAR preprocessing, segmentation/clustering, and tracking pipeline
- `/joy` from the shore PC -> `joy_converter` -> `thruster_driver` ->
  `micon_driver_fd`

Camera/YOLO detection is not started because it is not part of this sensor
configuration. The LiDAR detection pipeline can be disabled for troubleshooting
with `enable_detection:=false`.

## Interfaces

- `joy` (`sensor_msgs/msg/Joy`) is read by both manual nodes.
- `joy_converter_node` publishes `/cmd_vel_manual`, `/soft_emg`, `/red`, `/yellow`, and `/green`,
  and requests `manual` / `auto` on `/system/operating_mode`.
- `command_arbiter_node` is the sole publisher of `/cmd_vel` and `/system/control_status`.
  It selects manual commands only in `manual` mode, selects `/cmd_vel_nav` only in `auto` mode
  when `/autonomy/ready` is true, and publishes zero velocity during an emergency stop or when
  the selected command is stale (0.5 s).
- `/soft_emg` uses positive logic: button 0 sends `true` (emergency stop), while its
  normal released state sends `false` (emergency stop released).
- `manual_control.launch.py` uses UM982-only feedback by default, without the
  EKF.  The UM982 driver natively publishes `odometry/feedback`
  (`nav_msgs/msg/Odometry`), and this launch remaps it to the existing
  `/odometry/filtered/local` interface.  Its surge/sway velocity is a filtered
  GNSS position difference rotated into the boat frame by the dual-antenna
  heading, and its yaw rate is the heading difference.  This requires a stable
  outdoor GNSS fix.  Pass
  `enable_um982_velocity_feedback:=false` to restore the prior EKF path.
  The default `um982_feedback_mode:=ekf` uses the dedicated UM982-only EKF;
  `um982_feedback_mode:=window` selects the time-window regression alternative.
- `micon_driver_fd/serial_writer` automatically requests ARM. Joystick input cannot
  request DISARM; after an emergency stop is released or the ESP32 resets, the
  driver re-requests ARM once the required zero-thrust command is acknowledged.
  The ESP32's physical and communication emergency-stop interlocks remain active.

The command flags are `bit3=emg`, `bit2=green`, `bit1=yellow`, and `bit0=red`.
The ESP32 enforces the emergency stop and other safety interlocks. Validate that
behavior on restrained hardware before operation.

```bash
ros2 launch simple_manual manual_control.launch.py serial_port:=/dev/ttyUSB0
```

`simple_manual.launch.py` is also provided as a compatibility alias:

```bash
ros2 launch simple_manual simple_manual.launch.py serial_port:=/dev/ttyUSB0
```

The `axis.*`, `button.*`, and `scale.*` parameters belong to the
`/joy_converter` node and can be changed with ROS 2 parameter commands.

## Running the joystick on the shore PC

`manual_control.launch.py` does not start `joy_node`. Start it on the shore PC
in the same ROS domain so its `/joy` topic reaches the vessel PC.

## Pairing a DualShock4 controller over Bluetooth

The shore PC's `joy` node reads from `/dev/input/js0`, which requires the
DualShock4 to be paired and connected over Bluetooth first.

MAC address on record: `28:C1:3C:3F:D4:80`

1. Put the controller into pairing mode: hold **PS + SHARE** simultaneously
   for ~5 seconds until the light bar flashes white rapidly.
2. On the host (Jetson), run `bluetoothctl` and execute:
   ```
   agent on
   default-agent
   pairable on
   scan on
   ```
   Wait until `Device 28:C1:3C:3F:D4:80 Wireless Controller` appears, then
   `scan off`.
3. Pair, trust, and connect:
   ```
   pair 28:C1:3C:3F:D4:80
   trust 28:C1:3C:3F:D4:80
   connect 28:C1:3C:3F:D4:80
   ```
   `pair` only needs to succeed once; on subsequent uses (after re-enabling
   pairing mode on the controller) `connect` alone is enough. If `connect`
   fails with `br-connection-create-socket`, the controller is not currently
   in pairing mode — repeat step 1.
4. Verify the joystick device node exists:
   ```bash
   ls /dev/input/js0
   ```
5. Start `joy_node` on the shore PC:
   ```bash
   ros2 run joy joy_node
   ```

To disconnect: `bluetoothctl disconnect 28:C1:3C:3F:D4:80`. The pairing
(trust) persists across reboots, so a bare `connect` (after waking the
controller with the PS button) is usually sufficient after the first setup.
